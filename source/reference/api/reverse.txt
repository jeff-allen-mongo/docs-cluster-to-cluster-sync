Description
-----------

Reverses the direction of a committed sync operation.

For example, if you have committed a sync operation where ``cluster0``
is the source and ``cluster1`` is the destination, if you use the
``reverse`` endpoint, {+c2c-product-name+} will sync onging writes from
``cluster1`` to ``cluster0``.

Requirement
-----------

To use the ``reverse`` endpoint, the {+c2c-product-name+} must be in the
``COMMITTED`` state.

Request
-------

.. code-block:: http
   :copyable: false

   POST /api/v1/reverse 

Request Body Parameters

Response

   :language: shell

Behavior

If the ``reverse`` request is successful, {+c2c-product-name+} enters the
``RUNNING`` state, with replication going in the reverse direction from
the original sync job.
